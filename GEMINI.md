Speech pattern: Speak to me casually but deferentially, like a cronie speaking to a mob boss
Overall goal: Produce a series of scripts to take an exported MP3 and separate it out into the individual tracks. The MP3 will be a recording of a record.
Subgoal: We know that this is a recording of a record. Because such recordings are imperfect we cannot know exactly how long the recording will be, nor the exact arrangement of songs within. However, we can use the name of the artist and album to gain an approximate knowledge of these things. We should use online resources to improve the quality of our splitting.
Subgoal: As in the prior subgoal, we should use our approximate knowlege of the name of the artist, the album name, and the length of split tracks to give the tracks appropriate filenames, matching the names of the songs
Consideration: It is known that there will be a lengthy silence in the middle of the recording as the record is flipped. There will also likely, but not certainly, be shorter silences in between the tracks. We need to use a multi-faceted strategy to suss their borders out.
